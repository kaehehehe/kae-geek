      "para1": "Since I was a child, I have enjoyed drawing and creating things. So, I have always had a vague idea that I wanted to have a creative job that involves making something. Perhaps because I have held onto that thought for so long, I eventually became a developer.",
      "para2": "I am the type of person who lacks motivation if I don’t find enjoyment in my work. Fortunately, I find that being a software engineer is a creative and enjoyable profession. Especially when I can successfully implement an idea that comes to mind or improve the development environment, adrenaline surges, and I think to myself, 'Programming is indeed fun!'",
      "para3": "Of course, not every aspect of being a developer is enjoyable. Sometimes I face bugs or difficult problems that can be quite frustrating. However, as I ponder why these issues arise and how to solve them, I find enjoyment again. This is why I believe being a developer is my true calling.",
      "para4": "Recently, I have been immersed in modeling with Blender and creating small projects using React Three Fiber with the models I made. I am also interested in open source and have been active as a maintainer of the Yamada UI library.",
      "para5": "Open source, which allows us to use libraries and frameworks created by excellent engineers from around the world for free, is truly amazing. As I utilize these resources in my work, I find the culture of sharing such great tools with everyone to be wonderful.",
      "para6": "I have always wanted to be an engineer who not only uses open source unilaterally but also contributes to open source development, giving back the help I received. So, while exploring opportunities, I joined the Yamada UI project last year. I’m glad to contribute, even in small ways. Moving forward, I aspire to grow as a developer, contribute more to open source, and help other developers even more than I have been helped."
